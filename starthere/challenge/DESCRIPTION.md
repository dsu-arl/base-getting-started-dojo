Most challenges will have files stored in the `/challenge` directory.
A directory is just a folder that you can store files in. 
The last challenge ran a file automatically when the terminal was opened, but this challenge requires you to run the file yourself. 
You will need to run the `/challenge/solve` file to get the flag. 
To run this file:
1. start the VSCode Workspace
2. open a terminal
3. type `/challenge/solve` in the terminal and press `Enter`
4. copy/paste the flag to submit!
