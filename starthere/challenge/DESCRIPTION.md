Most challenges will have files stored in the `/challenge` directory.
A directory is just a folder that you can store files in. 
The last challenge ran a file automatically when the terminal was opened, but this challenge requires you to run the file yourself. 
You will need to run the `/challenge/solve` file to get the flag. 
To run this file:
- start the VSCode Workspace
- open a terminal
- type `/challenge/run` in the terminal and press `Enter`

Then copy/paste the flag to submit!
